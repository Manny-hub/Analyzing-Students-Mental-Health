This project is part of the [DataCamp Guided Project](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/analyzing_students_mental_health/guided/SQL) titled **"Analyzing Students’ Mental Health"**.

## 📌 Objective
Explore how the **length of stay** in a foreign country impacts the **mental health** of international students by analyzing psychological test results.

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information on:
- Mental health diagnostics:  
  - `todep`: Depression score (PHQ-9)  
  - `tosc`: Self-compassion score (SCS)  
  - `toas`: Acculturative stress score (ASISS)  
- Student category (`inter_dom`) — either *Inter* (International) or *Dom* (Domestic)
- Length of stay (`stay`) in the host country

## 📊 Analysis Summary
We calculated:
- The number of **international students** (`count_int`) per length of stay
- Their **average** scores in PHQ-9, SCS, and ASISS tests
- Results sorted by **length of stay** in descending order (showing the top 9 groups)
